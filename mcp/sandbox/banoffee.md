# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk (for toffee)
- 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (or digestive biscuits, crushed)
- 1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 3 ripe bananas
- 1 cup heavy cream (whipping cream)
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Chocolate shavings or cocoa powder (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Make the Toffee (Dulce de Leche):**
   - Boil the unopened can of sweetened condensed milk in a pot of water for about 2-3 hours. Make sure the can is always submerged in water to avoid any danger.
   - Alternatively, use pre-made dulce de leche.

2. **Prepare the Crust:**
   - Mix the graham cracker crumbs with melted butter until combined.
   - Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan.
   - Chill the crust in the refrigerator while the toffee cools.

3. **Assemble the Base:**
   - Once the toffee has cooled and thickened, spread it evenly over the chilled crust.

4. **Add Bananas:**
   - Slice the bananas and layer them evenly on top of the toffee.

5. **Whip the Cream:**
   - Whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.
   - Spread the whipped cream over the banana layer.

6. **Garnish:**
   - Sprinkle chocolate shavings or dust with cocoa powder for decoration.

7. **Serve:**
   - Chill the pie in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.
